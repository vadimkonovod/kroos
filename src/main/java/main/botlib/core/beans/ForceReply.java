	 * that are @mentioned in the text of the Message
	 * object; 2) if the bot's message is a reply (has
	 * reply_to_message_id), sender of the original message.
	 * 
	 * Example: A poll bot for groups runs in privacy mode
	 * (only receives commands, replies to its messages and
	 * mentions). There could be two ways to create a new poll:
	 * 
	 * - Explain the user how to send a command with parameters
	 * (e.g. /newpoll question answer1 answer2). May be appealing
	 * for hardcore users but lacks modern day polish.
	 * - Guide the user through a step-by-step process. ‘Please
	 * send me your question’, ‘Cool, now let’s add the first answer
	 * option‘, ’Great. Keep adding answer options, then send /done
	 * when you‘re ready’.
	 * 
	 * The last option is definitely more attractive. And if you use
	 * ForceReply in your bot‘s questions, it will receive the user’s
	 * answers even if it only receives replies, commands and
	 * mentions — without any extra work for the user.
